        The AK-47, officially known as the Avtomat Kalashnikova also known as the Kalashnikov or just AK, is a gas-operated assault rifle. Developed in the Soviet Union by Russian small-arms designer Mikhail Kalashnikov, it is the originating firearm of the Kalashnikov (or "AK") family of rifles. After more than seven decades, the AK-47 model and its variants remain the most popular and widely used rifles in the world.
        It was designed for all-around ease of use: easy to repair, easy to unjam (if it ever does), easy to maintain. If a round is chambered in an AK-47, chances are good that weapon is going to fire. His creation was so simple and dependable that the Soviet Union began exporting the weapon in mass.
