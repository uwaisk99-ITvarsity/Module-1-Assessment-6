        These tactical vests are designed to be comfortable. The lightweight construction reduces fatigue in the wearer, without reducing protection. Tactical vests are an important part of SWAT assault gear. It is best to choose a high quality vest, even if it is costlier. They will be more comfortable and last for years compared to cheaper designs. Make sure it has enough pockets to hold everything. Tactical vests are not only popular with military and law enforcement, but their benefits are being utilized in fishing, hunting, and paint ball.
